# SudokuSolver
##### This is a simple sudoku solver with a graphical user interface written in Windows Presentation Foundation using Visual Studio 2019 Community.
##### The idea is that you see a Sudoku board that you cannot solve, and plug it into this flexible software that can handle odd/even tiles as well as restrictions for diagonals, knight's move, and king's move.
##### Currently not under development, but thermometer and irregular sudoku support is also planned; possibly ice breaker sudoku as well.
##### I have no incentive to do this beyond being good practice for WPF that uses it more or less as intended, and as a programming challenge.
